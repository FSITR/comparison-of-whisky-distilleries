# Comparison-of-Whisky-distilleries
## Purpose
- To identify which Scottish distilleries to visit/buy from, to experience the broadest range of flavour profiles within Whisky.

## Introduction and backround information
- There are over a hundred whisky distillieries in Scotland, and various machine learning analysis investigating the clusters that exist.
- As I have an interest in whisky and have visited these regions I am performing my own analysis to compare with others, and to better understand the flavour profiles of whisky.
- I would like to therefore identify (with the aim of visiting) the most representative distilleries for each 'flavour class' that is present.

## Problem statement
- What flavour profiles exist across all distillieries, and which are the best to visit to experience these flavours?
